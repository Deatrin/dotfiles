# Dotfile Storage

Leveraging Nix with nix-darwin or nixOS with home manager to apply desiered configuration to machines

## Background

I just want to be able to get a new machine run a few commands and have it be exactly as I like that way the turn up to working and computing is wayyyyy faster I also dont have to try and remember that one setting from long ago that I will never remember

## Referances

- Not gonna lie most of this was made possible by stumbling on [billimek's](https://github.com/billimek/dotfiles/tree/master) dotfiles while I was trying to figure out how to get [nvf](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf) to work with nix darwin
- Shoutouts to code search on github wayyyyy better than any google seach to find examples
- Nix is a rabbit hole once I found I could merge both nixOS and nix-darwin files this was the outcome
